Machine learning is a type of technology where computers learn to make decisions or 
predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so. This is done by feeding 
the computer lots of data and algorithms that help it identify patterns and make 
sense of the information. The computer uses this data to learn and improve its 
performance over time. It's like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and 
make decisions based on examples it has seen before.
